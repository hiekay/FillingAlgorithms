# FillingAlgorithms
A test program that gathers 6 Filling Algorithms based on Android and implemented in Java. These algorithms are:
* __Seed Filling Algorithm (种子填充算法)__
   dsdfsdfsdf
* __Point-by-point Filling Algorithm (逐点判断算法)__:
* __Scanline Filling Algorithm (扫描线填充算法)__:
* __Active-edge-table Filling Algorithm (活性边表填充算法):

## How to Use and Test
1. Draw a polygon on the canvas as you want.
2. Click a button below (i.e. a filling algorithm) to fill the polygon with red color.<br>
   __notes:__ 
  * if you choose 'Seed Filling Algorithm (the first button)' or 'Scanline Filling Algorithm (the third button)', you must have to click anywhere in polygon to appoint a point (i.e. the seed). Only in this way can these 2 filling processes begin.<br>
  * if you choose the other algorithms, you don't have to take any other subsequent actions.

## Environment and Settings
* Download and install [Android Studio](http://www.android-studio.org/index.php/component/content/category/88-download).
* Install Android SDK 4.4.
* Import the whole project 'ScanlineTest' into Android Studio.
* At last, maybe you should enter 'File > Settings > Editor > File Encodings' and adjust 'IDE Encoding', 'Project Encoding' and 'Default encoding for properties files' to 'GBK'.
