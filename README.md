# FillingAlgorithms
A test program that gathers 6 Filling Algorithms based on Android and implemented in Java. These algorithms are:
* __Seed Filling Algorithm (种子填充算法)__:
  ssd
* __Point-by-point Filling Algorithm (逐点判断算法)__:
  sdfsdf
* __Scanline Filling Algorithm (扫描线填充算法)__:
  dfdf
* __Active-edge-table Filling Algorithm (活性边表填充算法)__:
  qsf

## How to Use and Test
1. Draw a polygon on the canvas as you want.
2. Click a button below (i.e. a filling algorithm) to fill the polygon with red color.__Notes__:
 * if you choose __'Seed Filling Algorithm (the first button)'__ or __'Scanline Filling Algorithm (the third button)'__, you must have to click anywhere in polygon to appoint a point (i.e. the seed). Only in this way can these 2 filling processes begin.
 * if you choose __the other algorithms__, you don't have to take any other subsequent actions.

## Environment and Settings
* Download and install [Android Studio](http://www.android-studio.org/index.php/component/content/category/88-download).
* Install __Android SDK 4.4__ but is not necessary.
* Import the whole project __'ScanlineTest'__ into Android Studio.
* At last, maybe you should enter __'File > Settings > Editor > File Encodings'__ and adjust __'IDE Encoding'__, __'Project Encoding'__ and __'Default encoding for properties files'__ to __'GBK'__.
